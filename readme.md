# Analysis of UFO Sighting Data

In this project we tried to analyze different MIME types of data and join it together to derive conlusions.
We chose following three datasets

Dataset 1 – Meteorite Landings: Mime Type – Application/JSON
Source - https://data.nasa.gov/resource/y77d-th95.json?$limit=50000

Dataset 2 – Census Data: MIME Type – text/CSV
Input data Sources:  We took Census 2000 and 2010 data from  https://factfinder.census.gov/, Open data source at https://github.com/grammakov/USA-cities-and-states?files=1

Dataset 3 – Sci-Fi Movies: Mime Type – text/HTML
Sci-Fi Movies (e.g. Star Wars, Star Trek) released - based on the year of release of sci-fi movies and the year of the UFO sightings, we can predict if whether the UFO sighting was a delusion or not.
